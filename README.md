**Repository Overview**

This repository contains provides a simple demonstration of how to use the `itemanalysis` package.

Note that there are much better tools available for free to run classical item analysis. This package was originally developed in 2013 to supplement the content I was teaching in a measurement course at the University of Miami. Therefore, it is customized and aligned with the content I taught.
